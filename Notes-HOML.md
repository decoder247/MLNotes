## <a name="sec1"></a>1. Preface summary*
**Reference from p. 13-26*

#### Tools/Framework to be used:
* **Scikit-Learn (SL)**: FOSS ML framework
* **TensorFlow (TF)**: Google's ML framework
* **Keras (KR)**: High level ML API that can be used on top of Tensor (although tensor has its own implementation)
* **Python libs**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib

#### PART I Roadmap - ML Fundementals w/ SL:
1. Understanding ML's concepts, categories and applications
2. Main steps in an ML project
3. Learning by fitting a model to data
4. Optimising a cost function
5. Handling, cleaning & preparing data
6. Selecting & engineering features
7. Cross-validation: model selection and hyperparameters tuning
8. Underfitting and overfitting challenges (bias/variance tradeoff)
9. Curse of dimensionality (Dimensionality reduction)
10. Unsupervised: Clustering, density estimation and anomaly detection
11. Common: Linear/Polynomial regression, logistic regression, KNN, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Randome forests and Ensemble methods 

#### Part II Roadmap - Neural Nets (NNs) and Deep Learning (DL) w/ TF + KR:
1. Intro to Neural Nets (applications and definition)
2. Building and training NNs using Tensorflow + Keras
3. Architecture: Feedforward NNs, CNNs, Recurrent nets, LSTM Nets, autoencoders and GANs
4. Deep NNs training techniques
5. Scaling for large datasets (for NNs)
6. Reinforcement learning
7. Handling uncertainty with Bayesian Deep Learning

#### Useful Resources (Further reading + Code examples):
* Andrew Ng's course on [ML in coursera][1]
* Geoffrey Hinton's course on [NNs and DL][2]
* Joel Grus' [Data Science from scratch][3]
    * Hard-code from scratch
* François Chollet *Deep Learning with Python*
    * Creator of Keras libary. Very practical approach.
* Mostafa, Ismail, Lin *Learning from Data*
    * More theoratical approach
* Code examples used within this book: [GitHub Link][book-github]

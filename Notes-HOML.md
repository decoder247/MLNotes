## <a name="sec2"></a>2. Chapter I-1: The ML Landscape
**Reference from p. 29 - 61*

### 2.1 ML Definition
A computer program is said to learn from experience (E), with respect to task (T) and some performance measure (P), if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 
> I.O.W. - A program with experience, should perform better on new tasks if it is said to be 'learning'.

### 2.2 The Traditional approach vs the ML approach
![The traditional approach][i1]
Traditional, analytical approaches require an iterative process where you look at a set of problem, identify and devise a set a solutions that tackle a subset of the problem, and iterate from there so that the final solution solves the problem completely - i.e. a normal software dev process.

To summarize, ML is great for:
* Problems requiring a lot of hand-tuning and long list of rules
* Fluctuating environments: ML adapts to new data
* Complex problems without a good solution at all
* Getting insights about complex problems

However, instead of learning about the problem ourselves, identify patterns to solve ourselves, and specific solutions to each problems ourselves, we can get a computer to do it, faster and more straightforwardly with all the 21st century computational power made available to us. ***This is usually shorter, easier to mantain, and more accurate.***

In addition to this, the ML approach is adaptable to changes in new data. I.e. ***if the behaviour of new data is slightly different, the algorithm is able to adapt its solution without outside intervention. -> More independent than an analytical solution.***

Further, ML can solve problems that are either too complex. For complex solutions via traditional approaches - ***ML algorithms can be easily deployed, to solve complex problems, and find patterns in the problem space that is very hard to find traditionally***.

Finally, ML can ***help humans learn and discover patterns to the problem. I.e. reveal correlations. This is called Data Mining***

### 2.3 Types of ML systems
#### 2.3.1 Main categories:
1. Supervision level (A. Supervised, B. Semisupervised, C. Unsupervised, D. Reinforcement learning)
2. Ability to learn on the fly (A. Online vs B. Batch)
3. A. Instance based (comparing new to known data points) vs B. Model-based learning (detect pattern in data for predictions)

#### 2.3.2 Supervised Learning:
* *Classification*: Feed data with labels
* *Prediction via regression*: Feed predictors (features), to predict a task's future values
* Regression algorithms can be used for classification, i.e. *logistic regression* (probability of belonging to a class)
* Types:
    * KNN
    * Regressions (Linear, logistic)
    * Support vector machines (SVM)
    * Decision trees and random forests
    * NNs (not all are supervised!)

Note:
* Attribute is data type (e.g. mileage), feature is data type + value (mileage = 100)

#### 2.3.3 Unsupervised learning:
* Unlabelled learning, i.e. without an answer set
* *Clustering*: Helps segment/group data points. A *HCA* is able to further subdivide each group into smaller groups.
* *Visualisation*: Represented in 2D/3D space to manually inspect for data. Some smart clustering can be incorporated to prevent overlaps.
* *Dimensionality reduction*: Simplify data without losing too much info (i.e. compression)
    * i.e. feature extraction: Using a car's age to represent the wear and tear of a car
    * Usually done prior to a supervised learning method to simplify the problem set
* *Anomaly detection*: Removing outliers before feeding into learning method. Tolerant even with small % of outliers in training set.
* *Novelty detection*: Similar to anomaly, but less tolerant and only expects normal data during training
* *Association rule learning*: Discovers interesting relations between attributes (i.e. Beef shoppers also buy chicken)
* Types:
    * Visualisation algorithms (2D, 3D)
    * Clustering (K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis - HCA)
    * Anomaly detection and novelty detection (One-class SVM, Isolation forest)
    * Visualisation and dimensionality reduction (PCA, kernal PCA, Locally-linear embedding - LLE, t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding - t-SNE)
    * Association rule learning (Apriori, Eclat)

#### 2.3.4 Semisupervised learning:
* Partially labelled data, i.e. a lot of unlabelled, and a bit of labelled data
* E.g. Clustering an identified person in a set of photographs, once a label is given, the person is known across the photographs. Usually there are several clusters for the same person, repeated labelling improves accuracy.
* Types:
    * Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
        * Comprised of stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines 
        * RBMs trained sequentially, unsupervised, and fine-tuned using supervised techniques
    * Unsupervised pretraining

#### 2.3.5 Reinforcement Learning
* Learning system based on *Agents* - observe the environment, select and perform actions, get *rewards/penalties* in return.
* Learn the best *policy* (strategy) for most points via rewards/penalties for the *agent* to take
* Application: Games, Robots (Tactic: Playing against itself)

![Reinforcement Learning][i1-12]

#### 2.3.6 Batch learning / Offline learning
* Defn: Incapable of learning incrementally, uses ALL available data
* Also known as *offline learning* as it generally is computate/time-intensive, and thus done offline
* Although needs retraining for new data, this process can be automated!
* Applications: Non-volatile data. Not suitable for autonomous learning on limited resources (i.e. phones, rovers)

#### 2.3.7 Online learning / Incremental learning
* Defn: Learns incrementally in sequence, either individually or in small mini-batches. Also termed as *incremental learning*.
* Advantages:
    * On-the-fly learning
    * Suitable for applications w/ limited resources (phones, rovers)
    * Saves space by discarding trained data (unless want to roll back to previous state)
    * Suitable for training huge datasets beyond capacity of core's memory, i.e. *out-of-core learning*, usually done OFFLINE!

* Disadvantages:
    * Need to consider *learning rate*, i.e. how adaptable the system is to new data.
    * *Learning rate üéó Noise and Outliers sensitivity*. Having a high learning rate will 'place less significance' on the old data and lower inertia to noise
    * Close monitoring required when dependent on quality of new data. If the new data is unreliable, manual intervention might be required, or an *anomaly detection algorithm* for abnormal data detection.

#### 2.3.8 Instance based learning
* Having a good performance measure is not enough, *the key is to perform well in new instances, i.e. ***generalisation****.
* *Defn*: As seen below, the new instance will be classified as a triangle as most similar instance belong to that class!
![Instance-based learning][i1-15]
* Example: A system learns the examples by heart, and generalises new instances by comparing them to learned examples (or a subset of them), using a *similarity measure*.
* Types:
    * Similarity measure (Does not find an average of the 'nearest neighbours'. K-NN does this instead, which is a regression model)

#### 2.3.9 Model based learning
* *Defn*: As seen below a model is made instead for the prediction/classification of the new instance.
![Model-based learning][i1-16]
* Case study: Life satisfaction of a country can be modelled via a linear model, e.g. *selected* based on one *attribute*: GDP per capita. This selection step is called *model selection*.
    * life_satisfaction = Œ∏<sub>0</sub> + Œ∏<sub>1</sub> √ó GDP_per_capita
    * *Model parameters*: Œ∏<sub>0</sub>, Œ∏<sub>1</sub>
* To determine a parameter value, a *performance measure* is required!
    * *Cost function*: How bad the model is. Typically used in linear regression.
    * *Fitness/Utility function*: How good the model is
    * Example: In linear regression, a cost function is typically used to 'fit' the line to the data points, with a minimised cost/error between prediction and training examples.
* Once a performance measure is determined, e.g. the linear regression algorithm, it can be fed the data / applied to *train the model* and determine the parameter values!
* Case study revisited:
    * life_satisfaction = Œ∏<sub>0</sub> + Œ∏<sub>1</sub> √ó GDP_per_capita
    * *Model parameters*: Œ∏<sub>0</sub>, Œ∏<sub>1</sub>
    * Use *linear regression* to train model and determine parameter values!
    * Gather + study the data ‚û° Model selection ‚û° Train the model (Using the learning algorithm that employs a cost/fitness fnc and determines the model parameters) + tune parameters ‚û° Apply the model on new cases, *inference*, hoping it generalises well
* Types:
    * Linear regression
    * Polynomial regression
    * K-NN regression

### 2.4 Main Challenges of ML
* Insufficient Training Data
* Data quantity VS Algorithm quality
    * *Norvig's* 2009 paper on "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data" and *Banko/Brill*'s 2001 paper both suggest quantity of data yields more effective performance + larger gains, even with simpler algorithms.
* Nonrepresentative training data
    * Learning method needs to account for outliers so that it can accurately generalise
    * ‚ùå Too small sample: Sampling noise i.e. Nonrepresentative data as a result of chance
    * ‚ùå Too large sample: Possibility of flawed sampling, i.e. *sampling bias* where data is biased based on the sampling method/grouping.
![A more representative training sample][i1-21]
* Poor quality data
    * Might need pre-processing (Outliers, noise, errors, missing features)

* Irrelevant features
    * *Feature engineering*: Consideration of features in the training step. Useful features are important, otherise *garbage in, garbage out*!
        * *Feature selection*: Most useful features
        * *Feature extraction*: Combining existing features to produce smt more useful (dimensionality reduction algorithms!)
        * Creating new features
* Overfitting the training data
    * Overgeneralising ‚û° i.e. works well on training data but not new data.
    * Overfitting happens when the model is too complex relative to noise, i.e. If the sample is too small, it will detect patterns in the noise itself
    ![Overfitting the training data][i1-22]
    * Solutions:
        * Simplify the model (linear > polynomial)
        * Gather more training data
        * Reduce noise
        * *Regularisation*: Constraining a model's parameters, i.e. by limiting its degrees of freedom
    * *Regularisation* can be controlled by a *hyperparameter*, which is a parameter of the learning algorithm (i.e. How a linear model and its parameters are determined) and not a model parameter itself (i.e. Œ∏<sub>0</sub>, Œ∏<sub>1</sub>). This is set prior to training, and remains constant during. Tuning hyperparameters is a challenge.
        * Too large: Flat model, not overfit training data
        * Too small: Overfitting might occur.
* Underfitting the training data
    * *Defn*: When a model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data
    * *Solutions*:
        * Selecting a more complex model, with more parameters
        * Feeding better features to the learning algorithm
        * Reducing the constraints of the model (e.g. reducing regularisation hyperparameter)

### 2.5 Testing and Validating
* To test, training data is typically split in to the *training set* (80%) and the *test set* (20%). 
* Error rate on new cases is called the *generalisation / out-of-sample error*, which evaluation on the test set will give a good estimation of.
* A low training error and high generalisation error indicates ‚û° OVERFITTING!

#### 2.5.1 Hyperparameter tuning and model selection
* A challenge in hyperparameter tuning is tuning the hyperparameters too perfectly for *that particular test set*!
    * Example: In tuning a regularisation hyperparameter (to avoid overfitting) for a linear model, it is found hyperparameter 'A' produces a model with the least generalisation error of 5%. However in production it produces 15% errors!
* *Holdout Validation*: Solution to selecting/tuning/training a model that is not too adapted to the test set (to a T issue)
    * Segment a small part of the training set to a *validation set*. The hyperparameter tuning and model selection first occurs on the smaller training set alone, and then the best model + hyperparameter is selected and trained on the full training set (including the *validation set*) to get the final model.
    * *Cross-validation*: Challenge here is determining the validation set size. Cross-validation solves this by using many small validation sets, and evaluating each model once per validation set and selecting the best one on average, before being trained on by the entire training set.

#### Data Mismatch
* When applying to problems of the real world, nonrepresentative data for training, in relation to the new data, can be a real issue.
    * Example: Image recognition app for plants on phones. Using web images to train is not very representative. Let's say we have limited representative data: 10 thousand camera imgs, and 10 million web imgs.
    * MOST IMPORTANT RULE, validation and test set must be as representative as possible. Half test, half validation.
    * If perform poorly on validation, a solution to find out if overfitting is an issue by...
